# Rules for great Product Spefics

Rules to achieve great Product Specs (PS / PRDs):
- The PS must be initially written by the person who knows the most about the product (owner).
- The PS must be carefully reviewed and commented by the product designer and the people who know the most about the components of the product that will be impacted (*eg. if the PS is about a new feature for the sales department, at least a salesperson must review it*).
- The **PS lives until the feature is launched**, therefore any new agreement or change in the product specification at any stage (design, development, testing...) must be reflected in the PS. The document owner is responsible to update it.
- Each person involved in the development process must carefully read the PS before getting involved. That is:
   - The designers must read it before drawing any wireframe.
   - The developers must read it before adding any line of code.
   - The testers must read it before thinking of any test.
