# Software development

During my years as CTO at [VoxFeed](https://voxfeed.com) and [Zenfi](https://zenfi.mx) recruiting, training and managing the development team I learned a lot from errors, experiments and the incredible people I've worked with.

I think much of this learning could be useful for other technical leaders and startup founders, so I created this space: to share and document the tools, procedures and principles that have worked for me to manage software development teams.
