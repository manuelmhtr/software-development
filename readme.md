# Software development

During my years as CTO at [VoxFeed](https://voxfeed.com) recruiting, training and managing the development team I learned a lot from multiple errors, experiments and the incredible people I worked with.

I think much of this learning could be useful for other technical leaders and startup founders, so I created this space. To share and document the tools, procedures and principles that have worked for me to manage software development teams.
